# esm-browser

The Environmental Assessment Office (EAO) is an independent provincial agency responsible for conducting Environmental Assessments , and administering the B.C. Environmental Assessment Act. 

The first phases of this project are in partnership with the OCIO DevOps Pathfinder.

## Features

EAO leads major project reviews and prepares an assessment report detailing the findings of its review, which may also contain recommendations. The report, along with the project application, is referred to two government Ministers, who decide on project approval. Once approved, an EA certificate is issued.
The public can find information on projects under review on the EAO's website. Work is underway to improve web access to project information. 

## Project Status
The project is actively developing towards a first release target of January 18, 2016.

## Goals/Roadmap
As part of the first release the esm-browser will be containerized and run in the OCIO DevOps Docker server environment.

In February the OCIO DevOps pathfinder team will be migrating the containers to be managed through RedHat OpenShift.
