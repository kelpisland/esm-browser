# esm-browser
A Project of the Environmental Assessment Office (EAO), BC Ministry of the Environment in partnership with the OCIO DevOps Pathfinder.

This application is a tool to support the work of EAO staff, project proponents, and other stakeholders as environmental assessments are conducted.

## Features
Need a blurb about the app features.

## Project Status
The project is actively developing towards a first release target of January 18, 2016.

## Goals/Roadmap
As part of the first release the esm-browser will be containerized and run in the OCIO DevOps Docker server environment.

In February the OCIO DevOps pathfinder team will be migrating the containers to be managed through RedHat OpenShift.
